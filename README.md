View Binding Sample
=============================================

This project shows how to use view bindings in an activity and in fragments. `RecycleViewFragment` shows how to use view bindings for `RecycleViewAdapter` and `CustomDialog`. `InflateFragment`
uses the `inflate()` API and `BindFragment` shows the less common `bind()` API.
